# Flying Anchors

### Dreamer Code
All of the code for the dreamer project is located on the Nightmares Branch.

There are 3 main Folders:

DreamerOnPendel  -Here you can find my latest code, this is code for the pendulum environment

Dreamer          -This is my code for the hockey environment, its missing some of the newer features from the Pendel file

ProjectTesting   -This is my very first dreamer test, where i was still using deterministic networks

**Important:** My latest commit on the DreamerOnPendel does not have a fitting model, therefore the NetTesting file does not work.

If you want to see my networks performance you have to go one commit back (its called e, i have no idea why i called it like that, please ignore the name).
