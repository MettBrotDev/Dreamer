# Flying Anchors

### Dreamer Code
All of the code for the dreamer project is located on the Nightmares Branch.

There are 3 main Folders:

DreamerOnPendel  -Here you can find my latest code, this is code for the pendulum environment

Dreamer          -This is my code for the hockey environment, its missing some of the newer features from the Pendel file

ProjectTesting   -This is my very first dreamer test, where i was still using deterministic networks

**Important:** My latest change on the DreamerOnPendel does not have a fitting model, therefore the NetTesting file does not work.

Thats why i called this one hotfix, since you can not check performance on that one. The training seemed to work on that one but for running the NetTesting file please use the non hotfix file.
